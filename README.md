# Description

Mini challenge 2 focuses on building a webpage that  holds a collection of CSS snippets. What better way to learn CSS than to build a knowledge base of CSS? This group challenge was completed by Liam Allen, Joon Kim, Trenton Kirchner, and Alexandria White.
# Instructions 

- As a user, I can view a collection of labeled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.
- As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.
- As a user, I can highlight a code snippet by clicking on it.
- As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.

## Specifications

* Must use semantic HTML elements and proper indentation.

* Use CSS variables to maintain clean and reusable values for a color scheme.

* Use flexbox and media queries to create a responsive grid layout.

* Each CSS snippet should have a card-like layout with the CSS syntax wrapped in an [HTML pre element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre).

* Each CSS snippet can easily be highlighted for copying on click using the [CSS user-select property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select).

* Must incorporate a background color using a [CSS linear-gradient function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient).

* Must incorporate a bit of animation using the [CSS transition property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition).

* You and your group can decide which CSS styles and colors you will use to design the application, but the app needs to be a responsive. Use the following images to gain an understanding of how the app should look at different screen sizes, from a layout perspective:

  * At size 992px and above, the app should resemble the following image:

    ![On a desktop, the application displays three CSS code snippets per row.](./assets/Images/01-app-desktop.png)

  * At size 768px and above, the app should resemble the following image:

    ![On a tablet, the application displays two CSS code snippets per row.](./assets/Images/02-app-tablet.png)

  * On mobile devices, anything under 768px, the app should resemble the following image:

    ![On a mobile device, the application displays one CSS code snippet per row.](./assets/Images/03-app-mobile.png)

# üìù Notes
* We learned how to use pre which is used to structure text, almost like hard coding spaces and indentations. This keeps the user from having to do individual lines and keeps the CSS code clean.
